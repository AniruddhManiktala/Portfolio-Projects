Pharmaceutical Marketing Assessment - README

Project Overview

This project analyzes the effectiveness of various marketing strategies used by a pharmaceutical company to promote a drug for a chronic condition. The objective is to evaluate the impact of these strategies on prescription lift and provide actionable recommendations to optimize future marketing efforts.

Project Structure

Medical Conference Assessment: Evaluate the ROI and physician engagement at medical conferences.

Marketing Program Assessment: Analyze historical data to assess the effectiveness of Speaker Programs, Free Samples, Loyalty Cards, and Sales Rep Details.

Methodology and Insights: Utilize data-driven techniques to identify key performance patterns and optimization opportunities.

Data Analysis Techniques

Multi-Factor Regression Analysis: Evaluate the relationship between marketing efforts and prescription volumes.

Time Series Analysis: Identify lag effects in marketing strategies.

K-Means Clustering: Segment physicians based on responsiveness to marketing tactics.

Heat Map Analysis: Visualize geographical performance differences.

Key Insights

Loyalty Cards: Demonstrated the highest lift in 2013; recommended to increase investment.

Speaker Programs: Declined in effectiveness; suggested reassessment or reallocation.

Sampling: Consistently correlated with higher prescription rates; maintain current investment.

Regional Focus: Prioritize efforts in the Northeast and Central regions.
